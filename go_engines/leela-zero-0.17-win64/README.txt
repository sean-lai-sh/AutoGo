Unzip and launch autogtp.exe.

You can specify the -g option to indicate the amount of games to 
play at once, i.e. autogtp.exe -g 4 will play 4 games at once,
using 4 cores. This might make your computer less responsive, so
autogtp defaults to 1 core only.

With the option -k <subdirectory-name> the games can be saved in a 
subdirectory.
